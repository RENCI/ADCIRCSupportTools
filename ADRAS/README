I am trying to get gadl installed. A simple comnda resulted in
in errors about error while loading shared libraries: libcharset.so.1:

# This approach worked for me. gdal and rasterio can fail to work together 

conda create -n myenv gdal rasterio pyyaml pandas numpy matplotlib netCDF4 geopandas

# Moving forward simply setupo the ev as follows

source activate myenv
gdalinfo --version

conda deactivate
